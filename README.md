# Quantum Wavefunction Visualizer ‚ú®

An interactive web application built with Next.js (App Router), TypeScript, and Chart.js to visualize the stationary state wavefunctions (Œ®) and probability densities (|Œ®|¬≤) for the classic "particle in a 1D infinite potential well" quantum mechanics problem.

## Overview

This application provides a visual tool to understand fundamental quantum concepts like:

*   **Quantization:** How only discrete states (defined by quantum number `n`) are allowed.
*   **Wavefunctions:** The mathematical description of a quantum state.
*   **Probability Density:** The likelihood of finding the particle at a given position.
*   **Nodes:** Points where the probability of finding the particle is zero.
*   **Boundary Conditions:** How the wavefunction behaves at the edges of the potential well.
*   **Effect of Confinement:** How changing the size of the "box" (`L`) affects the state.
*   **Normalization:** Ensuring the total probability of finding the particle is 1.

## Features

*   üìà Visualize both the wavefunction Œ®(x) and the probability density |Œ®(x)|¬≤.
*   üéöÔ∏è Interactively adjust the principal **Quantum Number (n)** using a slider.
*   üìè Interactively adjust the **Box Length (L)** using a number input.
*   ‚úÖ Toggle **Normalization** (applying the ‚àö2/L factor) with a checkbox.
*   üé® Uses Chart.js for clear and responsive plotting.
*    moderno Built with modern web technologies:
    *   Next.js 14+ (App Router)
    *   React 18+
    *   TypeScript
    *   Tailwind CSS for styling
